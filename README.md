Repo start date: Mar 7, 2023  
1. Created a repo on GH. (remote)  
2. Created a folder on the local machine, usually in the Documents folder. 
3. In VS Code, open the local folder via the Open Folder command. 
4. Clone the remote repo; I used the HTTP address because I didn't have SSH key. 
5. In VS Code, enter git clone `the http address`.  
You are now connected and can create commits.
